This is the submission to the Insight Data Engineering Coding Challenge (July 10, 2015).

This package performs the following:

1. Calculates the total number of times each word has been tweeted.
2. Calculate the median number of *unique* words per tweet, and update this median as tweets come in. 

This implementation was written in C++ using Xcode 6.4 on MAC OS X Yosemite. 

Files required:
/tweet_input/“tweets.txt”

Output files:
/tweet_output/“ft1.txt” - Stores the list of unique words and their frequency across all tweets.
/tweet_output/“ft2.txt” - Stores a running median of unique words per tweet
